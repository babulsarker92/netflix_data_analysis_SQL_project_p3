# Netflix Data Analysis SQL project 

## Overview

This project focuses on a detailed analysis of Netflix's movie and TV show data using SQL. The objective is to uncover key insights and address various business questions based on the dataset. This README outlines the project's purpose, business challenges, solutions, insights, and final conclusions in a structured format.

## Objectives

- Examine the distribution between content types, specifically movies versus TV shows.
- Identify and analyze the most common ratings across both movies and TV shows.
- Analyze content distribution by release year to identify trends over time.
- Evaluate the distribution of content by country to understand regional representation.
- Review and categorize content durations, including average lengths for movies and series.
- Explore and classify content based on specific keywords and criteria for targeted insights.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1. How many Movies and TV Shows are there in total?

```sql
SELECT
    type,
	COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix_database
GROUP BY type;
```
**Purpose/Objective:** Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix.

### Problem 2. What is the most frequently occurring rating among movies and TV shows?

```sql
WITH RatingRanks AS (
   SELECT
         type,
         rating,
         COUNT(*) AS count,    --This count tells us how many times each rating appears for each type (Movie or TV Show)         
		 RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking   --RANK() is a window function that assigns a ranking number based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause. PARTITION BY type means that the ranking calculation is done separately for each type (Movies and TV Shows are ranked separately).
   FROM netflix_database                                                   --ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ranks the ratings by their counts in descending order, with the most common rating for each type receiving a rank of 1.
   GROUP BY type, rating
)

SELECT
   type,
   rating
FROM RatingRanks   -- RatingRanks is Temporary Data set is made by using CTE
